# AICTE_IBM-Internship-project
AI-powered assistant for academic research using IBM Watsonx, Granite LLMs, and no-code tools. Summarizes papers, formats citations, and generates research content.

# 🧠 AI-Powered Research Agent – IBM SkillsBuild Hackathon Project 2025

## 🔍 Overview
The **AI Research Agent** is a no-code intelligent assistant built using IBM Cloud Lite, Watsonx Assistant, and IBM Granite large language models. It helps students, researchers, and educators perform key academic research tasks such as:

- 🔍 Literature search and summarization  
- 📚 Citation generation (APA, MLA, IEEE)  
- ✍️ Hypothesis and content generation  
- 🧠 Research trend analysis and topic recommendations  

Built as part of the **Agentic AI Challenge 2025**, this agent streamlines academic workflows and boosts research productivity.
